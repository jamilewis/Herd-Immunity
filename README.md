Infectious diseases can spread rapidly, posing significant threats to public health. Vaccines are among the most effective tools for disease prevention, as they reduce susceptibility to illness and help slow the transmission of pathogens. In this project, we used a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) computer model to explore how vaccines influence the spread of diseases, using COVID-19 as a real-world example. This choice highlights the role of vaccination in altering the trajectory of a pandemic, particularly in reducing active cases, deaths, and overall transmission.

To simulate different scenarios with varying vaccination rates, we employed the Gillespie algorithm, a well-established method for modeling stochastic processes in epidemiology. The Gillespie technique allows for the precise simulation of individual events in a population, such as infections, recoveries, and deaths, by randomly selecting events based on their probabilities and rates. By using this algorithm, we were able to generate realistic disease progression patterns and observe the effects of vaccination on controlling the spread of the virus.

These simulations provided valuable insights into how vaccines protect both individuals and communities. By adjusting the vaccination rates, we could see how higher vaccination coverage reduces the number of susceptible individuals and the spread of disease, as well as how vaccines help those who do become infected recover more quickly. Our findings underscore the critical role of vaccines in managing outbreaks and stress the importance of strategies aimed at increasing vaccination rates to protect public health.
