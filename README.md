The COVID-19 dataset includes statistics from every country during the pandemic in 2020. Our project focuses on active cases, deaths, and recoveries recorded at that time. Using this data, we calculated the death rate and recovery rate for each country. Additionally, the 2020 population dataset was utilized to compare the number of actively sick individuals to the total population of each country, providing a more accurate representation of the infection rate. The datasets were then merged together based upon country name.
